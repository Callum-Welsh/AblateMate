# AblateMate: Piezo Mirror Ablation Monitoring Software for Ultracold Molecule Experiments
Tired of turning the knob on your ablation laser to keep molecule loading high? Tired of cracking out your densest laser goggles to stare inside your beambox? You've come to the right place. AblateMate is an all in one ablation monitoring, control, and logging solution for ultracold molecule experiments using beamboxes.

## Features
- Mirror movement handled by a piezo mirror
- Webcam provides feedback on ablation position, allowing for real time moniroring and closed loop control.
- Comes with GUI tool to generate rastering trajectories
- Can talk to MOT monitoring camera via TCP
- Logs shots + MOT counts and generates real time heatmap of target useage and effectiveness.
- AutoConnor provides an automated assistant to keep molecules in your MOT (in development)

## Keyboard Commands
  - Click with mouse: set a new target position
  - l: Load a new automated raster pattern
  - n: Skip to the next point in raster pattern
  - h: Toggles MOT count heat heat map
  - z: Toggles AutoConnor assistant
  - esc: Disable piezo movement
  - q: Quit software
  - ?: Toggle instruction visibility
  - s: Open settings menu
